# Intern-Career
 Cyber Security - Internship

 Task 1: Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

Description:

Introduction interns to cybersecurity risk
assessment techniques and methodologies.

1. Threat Identification:

- Provide a sample network or system setup for assessment.

- Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities within the system.

2. Vulnerability Scanning:

- Use cybersecurity tools (e.g., Nmap, Nessus) to conduct vulnerability scans.

- Document identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and potential impact.

3. Risk Analysis:

- Assess identified vulnerabilities in terms of their potential risks to the system.

- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity and likelihood of exploitation.

4. Mitigation Strategies:

- Devise mitigation strategies for high-risk vulnerabilities.

- Suggest recommendations to address identified risks effectively.

5. Report and Presentation:

- Create a comprehensive report detailing the assessment process, findings, and mitigation
recommendations.

- Prepare a presentation
- 

Task 2: Incident Response Simulation
Description:

Simulate a cybersecurity incident scenario to
develop incident response skills.


1. Scenario Creation:

- Design a realistic cybersecurity incident scenario (e.g., malware attack, phishing
attempt).

- Outline the scenario
'
s context, objectives, and scope.

2. Incident Detection:

- Assign interns roles within the incident response team.

- Simulate incident detection through monitoring tools or provided logs.

3. Response Plan Execution:

- Initiate the incident response plan according to predefined roles and procedures.

- Contain and mitigate the simulated incident using appropriate strategies.

4. Forensic Analysis:

- Perform forensic analysis on affected systems or data to understand the
incident'

s root cause.

- Gather evidence and logs for post-incident analysis.

5. Post-Incident Assessment:

- Review the effectiveness of the response plan and actions taken.
- Identify areas for improvement and lessons learned from the simulation.

6. Documentation and Presentation:

- Document the incident response process, actions taken, and outcomes.
- Present findings and recommendations for enhancing incident response
capabilities.
